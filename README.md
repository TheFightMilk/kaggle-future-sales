# SCUM forecasting on Kaggle Future Sales data
The data is downloaded from the [kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales). The basic idea of this project is to test the Single Univariate Combination Method (SCUM) of forecasting sales. I don't expect it to perform very well here as there are a lot of intermittency in this data.

The `Benchmark.R` uses some simple regression methods to setup the benchmark forecasts. The `scum.R` has the code for the SCUM method.
